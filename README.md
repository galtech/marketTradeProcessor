This is an initial pre-release prototype that accepts a message, processes it, and displays it on screen. Currently the results are simply dumped to the screen, but the goal in a more formal release would include a highcharts visualisation of the data. 

A more formal release would also involve the use of a framework, most likely CakePHP.
